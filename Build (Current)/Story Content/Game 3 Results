        -   (Result_111) Look, here's the thing. I'm not even certain it's possible to see this ending. To see this, you need to have played three times, getting the worst possible result on every playthrough.
            And this is in a game where some of the bad choices disappear once you've picked them.
            I mean... in some ways this is an achievement.
            ...
            Yes. An achievement.
            Tell you what, this is painful. Let's say you won... in, like... your own special way.
                                    
            THE END

        -   (Result_222) I don't want you to feel bad, but by this point in the game you could be seeing one of twenty-one different endings.
            Do you know where this one ranks? Twentieth. Twentieth worst.
            One more time: you need. To pick up. The cracker.

        -   (Result_223) WE'RE NEARLY THERE. YOU HELD THE CRACKER. 
            IT WAS THERE IN YOUR TROTTER. 
            I BELIEVE IN YOU.
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_232) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            You were doing so well! 
            After an initial failure, you managed to hold a cracker... and now, you've gone back to not holding a cracker. 
            Shall we try again?
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_233) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            Okay, you're... getting there. Sort of. 
            After an inauspicious start, you've now managed the very difficult task of holding a savoury snack twice. 
            I think that, if you try really hard, you can get it from the trotter to the mouth. 
            I believe in you.
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_322) You had a strong start, followed by a persistent decline. You're New Labour.
            FROM THE TOP!
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_323) Well, we're back on track, we've managed to hold the cracker again. Good for you. Now... this time, eat it please.
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_332) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            Well you're not even trying now, are you? 
            Or are you so demoralised by failing to eat a cracker, twice, that now you can't even bring yourself to hold it?
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_333) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            I... I don't know how to help you. You've literally had a cracker in your trotter three times. THREE TIMES. Why aren't you eating it? It's the whole point of the... Just...
            Let's try again.
