        -   (Result_11X) That is twice in a row that you have not seen the cracker lying on the floor. 
            And frankly that is unacceptapig.

        -   (Result_12X) YOU LOSE! 
            You did not even hold that lovely cracker that you saw between your trotters, let alone munch it.

        -   (Result_13X) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            SO CLOSE! You had a cracker this time, but you did not munch it.

        -   (Result_32X) Right, you actually did worse this time. 
            You went from holding a cracker (but not eating it) to struggling with the very concept of holding a cracker.
                -> LoopStart
        
        -   (Result_33X) Meanwhile, I looked at the cracker.
            Right, I just want to check... you know you need to eat the cracker, right? Like, actually eat it. Not just hold it.
