====== Win
        YOU WIN! You munched a cracker!
        The End
        Many fanks for doing the playings, would you like to see what other ways this crunchy day could have gone?

            +   "That would be[ lovely, thankyou Rupert."]-"
                    OH GOODY!
                    
            +   "I'm a bit busy actu[ally, Rupert."]-"
                    YIPPEE! AGAIN, AGAIN!
    
            -   He's gone. You should follow him or he'll just collar some other poor person and pretend he's not had a cracker.
    
            +   Sigh & Restart.
                Just to be clear, the game's over. You can go now. This will restart the entire thing, as if you'd never played it at all.
    
                ++  I genuinely have nothing better to do.
                    # RESTART
                    -> DONE
        
        - (WinPlaceholder1) Urm... Nowt here.
